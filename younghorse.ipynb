    "# Markel/USEF Young and Developing Dressage Horse Championship Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project is to analyze data from the USEF Young and Developing Horse programs over the years. The program can be divisive—some claim that horses that participate in these programs end up washing out, or that many do not make it to the FEI levels. Since these programs have now been in place for over 20 years, there is a significant amount of data available to look at regarding the competitive careers of horses involved in these programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition and Cleaning\n",
    "The current format of the competition for all divisions (4/5/6/7 Year Old, Developing Prix St. Georges, and Developing Grand Prix) involves two rounds, with round one counting for 40% of the overall score, and round two counting for 60% of the overall score. Overall scores determine the final placings. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further complicate matters, early years of this program invited more horses to participate, and held both Final and Consolation Final rounds. To simplify this analysis, I did not include any Consolation Final results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more recent years of the competition (2021-2023), the competition software system Equestrian Hub (www.equestrian-hub.com) has automatically calculated these placings, which made it easy to obtain the data. For prior years, varying levels of detective work were required. I was able to find official overall placing records for some years on the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) website, but not all were available. For the years that had only the scores from each class available, I wrote a small program in Python to take each individual round of scores, and calculate the overall score using the 40/60 formula. While I have endeavored to do this without error, the lack of official overall rankings to compare to means that there may be errors involved as to exact overall placings of some horses. If you come across an error, please contact me at (byrne.sio@gmail.com) and I will make the correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I looked up each horse in the United States Dressage Federation (USDF) database, to determine a) what is the highest level to which this horse competed?,  and b) did this horse ever compete at the CDI (international) level? For a), I did not consider scores received—I was only concerned if that horse had a test on its record at that level. Therefore, this analysis does not differentiate between high and low scoring horses at any level. For b), I only considered horses to be CDI competitors if they had competed at a CDI at a level OTHER THAN FEI Young Horse tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had the most difficulty acquiring the data on bloodlines and breeders, ironically. Because so many people fail to include this information on entry forms, lots of the data was incomplete. USEF does have a horse search function on their website, but they only list sire and dam (no damsire), and frequently the breeder and country of birth are left out. Finding this information required a lot of detective work in some cases, frequently utilizing Horse Telex (www.horsetelex.com), a pedigree database. I also utilized old Eurodressage and DressageDaily articles about various years of the championships. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis of competitve careers of participants, I am focusing on the years 2002-2019. Horses that competed in the USEF 4 Year Old division in 2019 would be 8 in 2023, and 8 is the youngest age a horse can compete at the highest of the FEI levels, Grand Prix. While it is rare to see a horse competing at that level at that age, it is legal, so I went with the lowest legal age versus the most common (9-10 years old).\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of bloodlines and other breeding data will look at all years of the program (2002-2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2002 - 2019, 4/5/6 Year Old Division Competitive Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FEI vs Non-FEI Horses\n",
    "Do horses that compete in the 4, 5, and 6 Year Old divisions make it to FEI? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, I looked only at horses that competed in the 4/5/6 Year Old divisions during the years 2002-2019, 520 horses total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming majority made it to FEI (69.81%). 21.54% competed at the USEF levels (Training-Fourth). Only 45 horses (8.65%) never competed at any level other than a Young Horse division. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CDI vs Non-CDI Horses\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, most horses (67.50%) never competed in a CDI (international competition). Most horses, even if they make it to FEI, would not necessarily be competitive on the CDI level. CDI competitions are also much more expensive and complicated to enter and compete in (higher entry fees, horses must have an FEI passport). Finally, there are simply not that many CDI competitions in the USA, and the ones there are tend to be concentrated in certain areas, requiring long travel times for people in many parts of the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten vs Bottom Ten Placing Horses\n",
    "Are horses placing in the top ten vs bottom ten more likely to make it to FEI? Yes. 77.13% of horses that made it to the FEI levels placed in the top ten of their division at the championships. \n",
    "\n",
    "This finding may be influenced by the years this project is analyzing. In the early years of this program, there were frequently 10 or fewer horses in some divisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2002 - 2023, All Divisions (4/5/6/7 Year Old, Developing Prix St. Georges, Developing Grand Prix)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Highest Level Shown, USA Bred vs All Other Countries\n",
    "At the lower levels, there is a fairly balanced split between horses bred in the USA, and those bred in other countries. However, at the FEI levels, most horses are foreign-bred, with the most noticable difference being at the Grand Prix level (80 American-bred, 168 foreign-bred). There are likely many reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many people shop for horses in Europe because it is easier to see many horses in one location vs the USA\n",
    "* Depending on the exchange rate, it may be advantageous cost-wise to buy from other countries, as breeders in the USA face much higher costs to produce and raise foals\n",
    "* European countries produce far more warmblood foals than the USA\n",
    "* Bias against American breeders—some may think American-bred foals aren't as good as those produced in Europe\n",
    "* Hard to get top American-bred foals into the hands of riders that can develop them to Grand Prix\n",
    "* USA lacks a well-developed pipeline from foal to young horse to FEI\n",
    "* More young horse specialists in Europe makes it easier for buyers who may not have access to a good young horse specialist in their part of the USA\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Sires Represented\n",
    "The stallion with the most offspring competing (2002 to 2023, all divisions) was Sandro Hit (24). The rest of the top ten were Sir Donnerhall I (18), Furstenball (17), Jazz (13), Rotspon (12), Fidertanz (12), Florestan I (11), Hotline (10), Grand Galaxy Win (9), Florencio I (9), and Sir Sinclair (9). The three-way tie for ninth place in the top ten means there are actually eleven horses in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Damsires Represented\n",
    "The damsire with the most offspring competing (2002 to 2023, all divisions) was Rubinstein (25). The rest of the top ten were De Niro (18), Sandro Hit (17), Jazz (16), Rotspon (16), Weltmeyer (14), Ferro (13), Krack C (11), Sir Donnerhall I (11), and Rohdiamant (11). \n",
    "\n",
    "Frustratingly, this column had the second most null values of all the columns (18 missing values / 3.5% of the total)—I hope to resolve this in future iterations of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Sires of Grand Prix Horses\n",
    "The top sire of Grand Prix horses (2002-2023, all divisions) was also Sandro Hit (12). The rest of the top ten were Jazz (8), Sir Donnerhall I (7), Florestan I (5), Florencio I (5), Rotspon (4), Fidertanz (4), Sir Sinclair (3), Hotline (3), and Furstenball (3). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Damsires of Grand Prix Horses\n",
    "The top damsire of Grand Prix horses was De Niro (7). The rest of the top ten were Rubinstein (6), Rotspon (6), Ferro (5), Weltmeyer (4), Rohdiamant (4), Jazz (4), Sandro Hit (3), Sir Donnerhall (1), and Krack C (1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the prevalence of null values (just over 7% of the data) in the damsire column affects the completeness of this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top Ten Breeders Represented \n",
    "The most prominent breeder over all years and divions is DG Bar Ranch (USA), with 16 horses. The rest of the top ten were Maryanna Haymon (USA, 12 horses), Nancy Holowesko (USA, 9 horses), Leatherdale Farms (USA, 7 horses), Oak Hill Ranch (USA, 6 horses), Judy Yancey (USA, 6 horses), Horses Unlimited (USA, 6 horses), Gestut Lewitz (Germany, 6 horses), Maurine Swanson (USA, 5 horses), and Jackie Ahl-Eckhaus (USA, 5 horses). \n",
    "\n",
    "This column had the most null values overall—47 missing values, which equates to 9% of the total. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Most Championship Appearances\n",
    "The horse with the most appearances at the Young and Developing Horse Championships to date is WakeUp, ridden by Emily Miles. WakeUp competed in the Four and Six Year Old Championships as a young horse, and also competed two years each in the Developing Prix St. Georges and Developing Grand Prix divisions. \n",
